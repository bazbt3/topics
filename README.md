## A social network for me using GitHub.com Issues as conversation drivers (Topics!)  
Starting small, aiming lower.\*


## How I expect this to work:
* [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/topics-chat/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/topics-chat/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/topics-chat/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) - a chat application hosted at Gitter.im.  Login using GitHub credentials.  
  I've installed and signed into the Gitter Android app on my phone, but haven't tested a darned thing yet.

### The original intention:  
* **Create an [Issue](/../../issues/)** here as a conversation starter, respondents can leave comments below.  
   I intend to create and add a link to a public IFTTT.com applet to notify when something, anything, happens *here*.

\*I always *wanted* to host the next App.net, but if you want a polished, pleasant experience, go instead to **[10Centuries.org](https://10centuries.org/)**!  See you there, I'm @bazbt3.
